# ANN-For-Iris-Dataset
This program designs and implements a single-layer neural network to classify 3 ... First, the program trains the ANN, and then classifies the plants based on user ... This allows the user to test our model's ability on the iris dataset with a greater ... with the use of hidden layers that retain the connection weight of the prior layers.

 Learned about the detailed implementation of forward and backward propagation.
